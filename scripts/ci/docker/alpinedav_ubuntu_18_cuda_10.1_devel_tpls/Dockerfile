FROM alpinedav/ascent-ci:ubuntu-18-cuda-10.1-devel

# obtain a copy of ascent source from host env,
# which we use to call uberenv
COPY ascent.docker.src.tar.gz /
# extract ou
RUN tar -xzf ascent.docker.src.tar.gz

# at some sites ssl certs are intercepted, which cases issues fetching
# tpl sources via https

# to resolve this, either:
# 1) pass the "-k" option to uberenv (recommended),
# 2) install the proper certs into the image, or
# 3) use  the following commands to disable ssl for git and
#    curl (both are used by spack):
#RUN git config --global http.sslVerify false
#RUN echo insecure >> ~/.curlrc

# bootstrap third party libs using spack and uberenv
