Ascent
===========

Ascent is an open source many-core capable lightweight in situ visualization and analysis infrastructure for multi-physics HPC simulations.


Learn how to use Ascent with Docker + Jupyter
==============================================

If you have Docker, an easy way to learn about Ascent is to run our prebuilt Docker container:


    docker run -p 8888:8888 -t -i alpinedav/ascent-jupyter


Then open http://localhost:8888 in your browser to connect to the Jupyter Server in the container.
The password for the Jupyter server is: **learn**.  From here, you can run Ascent's Python Tutorial Notebook examples. For more details see our https://ascent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorial.html.
