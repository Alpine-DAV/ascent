Devil Ray
---------
Devil Ray is a visualization and analysis library for high-order element meshes targeting
modern HPC architectures. Devil Ray runs on both GPUs and many-core CPUs. Further, Devil Ray leverages
MPI for distributed-memory computations.
We support meshes consisting of hexs, quads, tets, and triangles of arbitrary polynomial order, with
fast paths for constant, linear, quadratic, and cubic elements.
Originally architected as a ray tracer, Devil Ray is capable of rendering volumes and surfaces.
Additionally, we support a limited set of filters and spatial queries.
Devil Ray has been demonstrated running concurrently on over 4,000 GPUs.

A great amalgamation occurred, bringing Devil Ray's source into Ascent's source repo.

In the post amalgamation world, Devil Ray is now developed as part of Ascent.
