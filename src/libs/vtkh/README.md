VTK-h
=====

VTK-h is a toolkit of scientific visualization algorithms for emerging processor architectures. VTK-h
bring together several projects like VTK-m and DIY2 to provide a toolkit with hybrid parallel capabilities.

A great amalgamation occurred, bringing VTK-h's source into Ascent's source repo.

In the post amalgamation world, VTK-h is now developed as part of Ascent.
