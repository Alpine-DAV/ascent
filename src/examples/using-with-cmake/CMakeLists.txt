# Example that shows how to use an installed instance of Ascent in another
# CMake-based build system.
#
# To build:
#  mkdir build
#  cd build
#  cmake \
#   -DAscent_DIR={ascent install path}   \
#   -DConduit_DIR={conduit install path} \
#   -DVTKH_DIR={vtkh install path}          
#   ../
# make
# ./ascent_render_example
#
# In order to run directly in a sub directory below using-with-cmake in an ascent install, 
# set Ascent_DIR to ../../..
# 
#  mkdir build
#  cd build
#  cmake .. -DAscent_DIR=../../..
#  make
#  ./ascent_render_example
