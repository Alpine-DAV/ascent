# Example that shows how to use an installed instance of Ascent in Makefile
# based build system.
#
# To build:
#  env ASCENT_DIR={ascent install path} make
#  ./ascent_render_example
#
# From within an ascent install:
#  make 
#  ./example
#
# Which corresponds to:
#
#  make ASCENT_DIR=../../../ 
#  ./example
