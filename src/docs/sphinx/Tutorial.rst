Tutorial
=================

This tutorial introduces how to use Ascent, including basics about:

 - Formating mesh data for Ascent
 - Using Conduit and Ascent's Conduit-based API
 - Using and combining Ascent's core building blocks: Scenes, Pipelines, Extracts, Queries, and Triggers
 - Using Ascent with the Cloverleaf3D example integration

Ascent installs include standalone C++, Python, and Python-based Jupyter notebook examples for this tutorial. 
You can find the tutorial source code and notebooks in your Ascent install directory under ``examples/ascent/tutorial/ascent_intro/`` and the Cloverleaf3D demo files under ``examples/ascent/tutorial/cloverleaf_demos/``.
