Releases
========

Ascent and its dependencies are under rapid development.
Because of this we recommend using our develop branch, which we aim 
to keep buildable via continuous integration testing. See our 
:doc:`Quick Start Guide <QuickStart>` for info on how to build Ascent and 
its dependencies.


Source distributions for Ascent are hosted on github:

v0.5.1
-------

* `v0.5.1 Source Tarball <https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/ascent/releases/download/v0.5.1/ascent-v0.5.1-src-with-blt.tar.gz>`_

Highlights
+++++++++++++

(Extracted from Ascent's :download:`Changelog <../../../CHANGELOG.md>`)

v0.5.0
-------

* `v0.5.0 Source Tarball <https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/ascent/releases/download/v0.5.0/ascent-v0.5.0-src-with-blt.tar.gz>`_

Highlights
+++++++++++++

(Extracted from Ascent's :download:`Changelog <../../../CHANGELOG.md>`)

Added
~~~~~~~~~

* Added new :ref:`Tutorial Content <tutorial_intro>` including C++, Python, and Python-based Jupyter Notebook examples.
* Added docs for :ref:`queries` and :ref:`triggers`
* Added a Jupyter Extract that provides interactive Python Notebook access to published mesh data. See the related :ref:`Cloverleaf Demo <cloverleaf_demo_jupyter_extract>`.
* Deprecated the `execute` and `reset` actions. `ascent.execute(actions)` now implicitly resets and execute the Ascent actions. To maintain a degree of backwards compatibility, using `execute` and `reset` are still passable to `ascent.execute(actions)`. Internally, the internal data flow network will only be rebuilt when the current actions differ from the previously executed actions. Note: this only occurs when the Ascent runtime object is persistent between calls to `ascent.execute(actions)`.
* Added support for YAML `ascent_actions` and `ascent_options` files. YAML files are much easier for humans to compose
* Add a relative offset option to the Slice filter.

Changed
~~~~~~~~~

* Several improvements to Ascent's Expression infrastructure.
* Updated our uberenv-based to use a 2019/11 version of spack develop.
* Improved Python error handling and propagation.

* Updated to VTK-m 1.5.0 and associated VTK-h.
* Imposed necessary static build constraints for cuda support.
