Learn how to use Ascent with Docker + Jupyter
==============================================

If you have Docker, an easy way to learn about Ascent is to run our prebuilt Docker container:

.. code::

    docker run -p 8888:8888 -t -i alpinedav/ascent-jupyter


Then open http://localhost:8888 in your browser to connect to the Jupyter Server in the container.
The password for the Jupyter server is: ``learn``.  From here, you can run Ascent's Python Tutorial Notebook examples. For more details see our :doc:`Ascent Tutorial <Tutorial>`.

Introduction
============

.. Ascent is a system designed to meet the in-situ visualization and analysis needs of simulation code teams running multi-physics calculations on many-core HPC architectures. It provides rendering runtimes that can leverage many-core CPUs and GPUs to render images of simulation meshes.

Ascent is an easy-to-use flyweight in situ visualization and analysis library for HPC simulations:

- Supports: Making Pictures, Transforming Data, and Capturing Data for use outside of Ascent
- Young effort, yet already includes most common visualization operations
- Provides a simple infrastructure to integrate custom analysis
- Provides C++, C, Python, and Fortran APIs

Ascent's flyweight design targets next-generation HPC platforms:

- Provides efficient distributed-memory (MPI) and many-core (CUDA or OpenMP) execution 
- Demonstrated scaling:  In situ filtering and ray tracing across 16,384 GPUs on LLNL's Sierra Cluster
- Has lower memory requirements than current tools
- Requires less dependencies than current tools (ex: no OpenGL)


Ascent focuses on ease of use and reducing integration burden for simulation code teams:

- Actions are passed to Ascent via YAML files
- Replay capability helps prototype and test actions
- It does not require GUI or system-graphics libraries
- It includes integration examples that demonstrate how to use Ascent inside existing HPC-simulation proxy applications


Getting Started
----------------

To get started building and using Ascent, see the :doc:`Quick Start Guide <QuickStart>`  and the :doc:`Ascent Tutorial <Tutorial>`. For more details about building Ascent see the :doc:`Building documentation <BuildingAscent>`.
