Building Ascent
===============

This page provides details on several ways to build Ascent from source.

For the shortest path from zero to Ascent, see :doc:`QuickStart`.

To build third party dependencies we recommend using :ref:`uberenv <building_with_uberenv>` which leverages Spack or :ref:`Spack directly<building_with_spack>`.
We also provide info about :ref:`building for known HPC clusters using uberenv <building_known_hpc>`.
and a :ref:`Docker example <building_with_docker>` that leverages Spack.

Overview
--------

Ascent uses CMake for its build system.
Building Ascent creates two separate libraries:

    * libascent : a version for execution on a single node
    * libascent_mpi : a version for distributed-memory parallel

The CMake variable( ENABLE_MPI ON | OFF ) controls the building the parallel version of Ascent and included proxy-apps.

The build dependencies vary according to which pipelines and proxy-applications are desired.
For a minimal build with no parallel components, the following are required:

    * Conduit
    * C++ compilers

We recognize that building on HPC systems can be difficult, and we have provide two separate build strategies.

    * A spack based build
    * Manually compile dependencies using a CMake configuration file to keep compilers and libraries consistent

Most often, the spack based build should be attempted first. Spack will automatically download and build all
the third party dependencies and create a CMake configuration file for Ascent. Should you encounter build issues
that are not addressed here, please ask questions using our github `issue tracker <https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/ascent/issues>`_.


Build Dependencies

    :align: center

Ascent
^^^^^^^^

  * Conduit
  * One or more runtimes

For Ascent, the Flow runtime is builtin, but for visualization functionality (filters and rendering), the VTK-h runtime is needed.

Conduit (Required)
""""""""""""""""""
  * MPI
  * Python + NumPy (Optional)
  * HDF5 (Optional)
  * Fortran compiler (Optional)

VTK-h (Optional)
""""""""""""""""

* VTK-h:

    * VTK-m:

      * OpenMP (Optional)
      * CUDA 7.5+ (Optional)
      * MPI (Optional)

.. note::

    When building VTK-m for use with VTK-h, VTK-m must be configured with rendering on, among other options.
    See the VTK-h spack package for details.

MFEM (Optional)
"""""""""""""""
  * MPI
  * Metis
  * Hypre

Getting Started
---------------
Clone the Ascent repo:

* From Github

.. code:: bash

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/ascent.git


``--recursive`` is necessary because we are using a git submodule to pull in BLT (https://github.com/llnl/blt).
If you cloned without ``--recursive``, you can checkout this submodule using:

.. code:: bash

    cd ascent
    git submodule init
    git submodule update



Configure a build:

``config-build.sh`` is a simple wrapper for the cmake call to configure ascent.
This creates a new out-of-source build directory ``build-debug`` and a directory for the install ``install-debug``.
It optionally includes a ``host-config.cmake`` file with detailed configuration options.


.. code:: bash

    cd ascent
    ./config-build.sh


Build, test, and install Ascent:

.. code:: bash

    cd build-debug
    make -j 8
    make test
    make install



Build Options
-------------

Ascent's build system supports the following CMake options:

* **BUILD_SHARED_LIBS** - Controls if shared (ON) or static (OFF) libraries are built. *(default = ON)*
* **ENABLE_TESTS** - Controls if unit tests are built. *(default = ON)*

* **ENABLE_DOCS** - Controls if the Ascent documentation is built (when sphinx and doxygen are found ). *(default = ON)*

* **ENABLE_FORTRAN** - Controls if Fortran components of Ascent are built. This includes the Fortran language bindings and Cloverleaf3D . *(default = ON)*
* **ENABLE_PYTHON** - Controls if the ascent python module and related tests are built. *(default = OFF)*

 The Ascent python module will build for both Python 2 and Python 3. To select a specific Python, set the CMake variable PYTHON_EXECUTABLE to path of the desired python binary. The ascent python module requires the Conduit python module.

* **ENABLE_OPENMP** - Controls if the proxy-apps are configured with OpenMP. *(default = OFF)*
* **ENABLE_MPI** - Controls if parallel versions of proxy-apps and Ascent are built. *(default = ON)*


 We are using CMake's standard FindMPI logic. To select a specific MPI set the CMake variables **MPI_C_COMPILER** and **MPI_CXX_COMPILER**, or the other FindMPI options for MPI include paths and MPI libraries.

 To run the mpi unit tests on LLNL's LC platforms, you may also need change the CMake variables **MPIEXEC** and **MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG**, so you can use srun and select a partition. (for an example see: src/host-configs/chaos_5_x86_64.cmake)

.. warning::
  Starting in CMake 3.10, the FindMPI **MPIEXEC** variable was changed to **MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE**. FindMPI will still set **MPIEXEC**, but any attempt to change it before calling FindMPI with your own cached value of **MPIEXEC** will not survive, so you need to set **MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE** `[reference] <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.10/module/FindMPI.html>`_.


* **CONDUIT_DIR** - Path to an Conduit install *(required)*.

* **VTKM_DIR** - Path to an VTK-m install *(optional)*.

* **HDF5_DIR** - Path to a HDF5 install *(optional)*.

* **MFEM_DIR** - Path to a MFEM install *(optional)*.

* **ADIOS_DIR** - Path to a ADIOS install *(optional)*.

* **BLT_SOURCE_DIR** - Path to BLT.  *(default = "blt")*

 Defaults to "blt", where we expect the blt submodule. The most compelling reason to override is to share a single instance of BLT across multiple projects.

Host Config Files
-----------------
To handle build options, third party library paths, etc we rely on CMake's initial-cache file mechanism.


.. code:: bash

    cmake -C config_file.cmake


We call these initial-cache files *host-config* files, since we typically create a file for each platform or specific hosts if necessary.

The ``config-build.sh`` script uses your machine's hostname, the SYS_TYPE environment variable, and your platform name (via *uname*) to look for an existing host config file in the ``host-configs`` directory at the root of the ascent repo. If found, it passes the host config file to CMake via the `-C` command line option.

.. code:: bash

    cmake {other options} -C host-configs/{config_file}.cmake ../


You can find example files in the ``host-configs`` directory.

These files use standard CMake commands. CMake *set* commands need to specify the root cache path as follows:

.. code:: cmake

    set(CMAKE_VARIABLE_NAME {VALUE} CACHE PATH "")

It is  possible to create your own configure file, and an boilerplate example is provided in `/host-configs/boilerplate.cmake`

.. warning:: If compiling all of the dependencies yourself, it is important that you use the same compilers for all dependencies. For
             example, different MPI and Fortran compilers (e.g., Intel and GCC) are not compatible with one another.


.. _building_with_uberenv:

Building Ascent and Third Party Dependencies
--------------------------------------------------
We use **Spack** (http://spack.io) to help build Ascent's third party dependencies on OSX and Linux.

Uberenv (``scripts/uberenv/uberenv.py``) automates fetching spack, building and installing third party dependencies, and can optionally install Ascent as well.  To automate the full install process, Uberenv uses the Ascent Spack package along with extra settings such as Spack compiler and external third party package details for common HPC platforms.


Uberenv Options for Building Third Party Dependencies
------------------------------------------------------

``uberenv.py`` has a few options that allow you to control how dependencies are built:

 ==================== ============================================== ================================================
  Option               Description                                     Default
 ==================== ============================================== ================================================
  --prefix             Destination directory                          ``uberenv_libs``
  --spec               Spack spec                                     linux: **%gcc**
                                                                      osx: **%clang**
  --spack-config-dir   Folder with Spack settings files               linux: (empty)
                                                                      osx: ``scripts/uberenv/spack_configs/darwin/``
  -k                   Ignore SSL Errors                              **False**
  --install            Fully install ascent not just dependencies     **False**
  --run_tests          Invoke tests during build and against install  **False**
 ==================== ============================================== ================================================

The ``-k`` option exists for sites where SSL certificate interception undermines fetching
from github and https hosted source tarballs. When enabled, ``uberenv.py`` clones spack using:

.. code:: bash

    git -c http.sslVerify=false clone https://github.com/llnl/spack.git

And passes ``-k`` to any spack commands that may fetch via https.


Default invocation on Linux:

.. code:: bash

    python scripts/uberenv/uberenv.py --prefix uberenv_libs \
                                      --spec %gcc

Default invocation on OSX:

.. code:: bash

    python scripts/uberenv/uberenv.py --prefix uberenv_libs \
                                      --spec %clang \
                                      --spack-config-dir scripts/uberenv/spack_configs/darwin/


The uberenv `--install` installs conduit\@master (not just the development dependencies):

.. code:: bash

    python scripts/uberenv/uberenv.py --install


To run tests during the build process to validate the build and install, you can use the ``--run_tests`` option:

.. code:: bash

    python scripts/uberenv/uberenv.py --install \
                                      --run_tests

For details on Spack's spec syntax, see the `Spack Specs & dependencies <http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#specs-dependencies>`_ documentation.


Compiler Settings for Third Party Dependencies
----------------------------------------------

You can edit yaml files under ``scripts/uberenv/spack_config/{platform}`` or use the **--spack-config-dir** option to specify a directory with compiler and packages yaml files to use with Spack. See the `Spack Compiler Configuration <http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#manual-compiler-configuration>`_
and `Spack System Packages
<http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#system-packages>`_
documentation for details.

For OSX, the defaults in ``spack_configs/darwin/compilers.yaml`` are X-Code's clang and gfortran from https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries#MacOS.

.. note::
    The bootstrapping process ignores ``~/.spack/compilers.yaml`` to avoid conflicts
    and surprises from a user's specific Spack settings on HPC platforms.

When run, ``uberenv.py`` checkouts a specific version of Spack from github as ``spack`` in the
destination directory. It then uses Spack to build and install Conduit's dependencies into
``spack/opt/spack/``. Finally, it generates a host-config file ``{hostname}.cmake`` in the
destination directory that specifies the compiler settings and paths to all of the dependencies.


.. _building_known_hpc:

Building with Uberenv on Known HPC Platforms
--------------------------------------------------

To support testing and installing on common platforms, we maintain sets of Spack compiler and package settings
for a few known HPC platforms.  Here are the commonly tested configurations:

 ================== ====================== ======================================
  System             OS                     Tested Configurations (Spack Specs)
 ================== ====================== ======================================
  pascal.llnl.gov     Linux: TOSS3          %gcc

                                            %gcc~shared
  lassen.llnl.gov     Linux: BlueOS         %clang\@coral~python~fortran
  cori.nersc.gov      Linux: SUSE / CNL     %gcc
 ================== ====================== ======================================


See ``scripts/spack_build_tests/`` for the exact invocations used to test on these platforms.


Building Third Party Dependencies for Development
--------------------------------------------------

You can use ``bootstrap-env.sh`` (located at the root of the ascent repo) to help setup your development environment on OSX and Linux.
This script uses ``scripts/uberenv/uberenv.py``, which leverages **Spack** (https://spack.io/) to build the external third party libraries and tools used by Ascent.
Fortran support in is optional, dependencies should build without fortran.
After building these libraries and tools, it writes an initial *host-config* file and adds the Spack built CMake binary to your PATH, so can immediately call the ``config-build.sh`` helper script to configure a ascent build.

.. code:: bash

    #build third party libs using spack
    source bootstrap-env.sh

    #copy the generated host-config file into the standard location
    cp uberenv_libs/`hostname`*.cmake host-configs/

    # run the configure helper script
    ./config-build.sh

    # or you can run the configure helper script and give it the
    # path to a host-config file
    ./config-build.sh uberenv_libs/`hostname`*.cmake


.. .. note::
..     There is a known issue on some OSX systems when building with Fortran dependencies.
..     This is caused by the native compilers being 64-bit while the Fortran compiler is 32-bit.


.. _building_with_spack:

Building with Spack
-------------------

Currently, we maintain our own fork of Spack for stability. As part of the uberenv python
script, we automatically clone our
`Spack fork. <https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/spack/tree/task/2018_04_update_ascent>`_

.. warning::
  Installing Ascent from the Spack master branch will most likely fail. We build and test spack
  installations with uberenv.py.

To install Ascent with all options (and also build all of its dependencies as necessary) run:

.. code:: bash

  spack install ascent

To build and install Ascent with CUDA support:

.. code:: bash

  spack install ascent+cuda


The Ascent Spack package provides several
`variants <http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#specs-dependencies>`_
that customize the options and dependencies used to build Ascent:

 ================== ==================================== ======================================
  Variant             Description                          Default
 ================== ==================================== ======================================
  **shared**          Build Ascent  as shared libraries    ON (+shared)
  **cmake**           Build CMake with Spack               ON (+cmake)
  **python**          Enable Ascent Python support         ON (+python)
  **mpi**             Enable Ascent MPI support            ON (+mpi)
  **vtkh**            Enable Ascent VTK-h support          ON (+vtkh)
  **tbb**             Enable VTK-h TBB support             ON (+tbb)
  **cuda**            Enable VTK-h CUDA support            OFF (~cuda)
  **doc**             Build Ascent's Documentation         OFF (~doc)
  **mfem**            Enable MFEM support                  OFF (~mfem)
 ================== ==================================== ======================================



Variants are enabled using ``+`` and disabled using ``~``. For example, to build Conduit with the minimum set of options (and dependencies) run:

.. code:: bash

  spack install ascent+cuda~python~doc


See `Spack's Compiler Configuration <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#compiler-config>`_ to customize which compiler settings.


Using system installs of dependencies with Spack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Spack allows you to specify system installs of packages using a `packages.yaml
<https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_settings.html#build-settings>`_ file.


Here is an example specifying system CUDA on MacOS:

.. code:: yaml

  # CUDA standard MacOS install
    cuda:
      paths:
        cuda@9.0: /Developer/NVIDIA/CUDA-9.0
    buildable: False


Here is an example of specifying system MPI and CUDA on an LLNL Chaos 5 machine:

.. code:: yaml

    # LLNL toss3 CUDA
      cuda:
        modules:
           cuda@9.1: cuda/9.1.85
        buildable: False
    # LLNL toss3 mvapich2
      mvapich2:
        paths:
          mvapich2@2.2%gcc@4.9.3:  /usr/tce/packages/mvapich2/mvapich2-2.2-gcc-4.9.3
          mvapich2@2.2%intel@17.0.0: /usr/tce/packages/mvapich2/mvapich2-2.2-intel-17.0.0
          mvapich2@2.2%clang@4.0.0: /usr/tce/packages/mvapich2/mvapich2-2.2-clang-4.0.0
        buildable: False

Settings for LLNL TOSS 3 Systems:
 * :download:`compilers.yaml <spack_configs/toss_3_x86_64_ib/compilers.yaml>`
 * :download:`packages.yaml <spack_configs/toss_3_x86_64_ib/packages.yaml>`

.. _paraview_ascent_support:

ParaView Support
----------------

Ascent ParaView support is in `src/examples/paraview-vis <https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/ascent/blob/develop/src/examples/paraview-vis>`_ directory.
This section describes how to configure, build and run the example
integrations provided with Ascent and visualize the results insitu
using ParaView. ParaView pipelines are provided for all example
integrations.  We describe in details the ParaView pipeline for
``cloverleaf3d`` in the :ref:`paraview_visualization` section.

.. _paraview_setup_spack:

Setup spack
^^^^^^^^^^^
Install spack, modules and shell support.

- Clone the spack repository:

  .. code:: bash

            git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git
            cd spack
            source share/spack/setup-env.sh

- If the ``module`` command does not exist:

  - install ``environment-modules`` using the package manager for your system.

  - run ``add.modules`` to add the ``module`` command to your ``.bashrc`` file

  - Alternatively run ``spack bootstrap``

.. _paraview_install:

Install ParaView and Ascent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- For MomentInvariants (optional module in ParaView for pattern
  detection) visualization patch ParaView to enable this module:

  - Download the `MomentInvariants patch <https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/ascent/blob/develop/src/examples/paraview-vis/paraview-package-momentinvariants.patch>`_

  - Patch paraview: ``patch -p1 < paraview-package-momentinvariants.patch``

- Install ParaView (any version >= 5.7.0)

  - ``spack install paraview@develop+python3+mpi+osmesa~opengl2^mpich``

  - for CUDA use: ``spack install paraview@develop+python3+mpi+osmesa~opengl2+cuda^mpich``

- Install Ascent (any version)

  - ``spack install ascent@develop~vtkh^mpich``

  - If you need ascent built with vtkh you can use ``spack install
    ascent@develop^mpich``. Note that you need specific versions of
    ``vtkh`` and ``vtkm`` that work with the latest Ascent.  Those
    versions can be read from ``scripts/uberenv/project.json``
    by cloning ``spack_url``, branch ``spack_branch``.
    ``paraview-package-momentinvariants.patch`` is already setup to
    patch ``vtkh`` and ``vthm`` with the correct versions.

- Load required modules: ``spack load conduit;spack load python;spack load py-numpy;spack load py-mpi4py;spack load paraview``

.. _paraview_run_integrations:

Setup and run example integrations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can test Ascent with ParaView support by running the available
integrations. Visualization images will be generated in the current
directory. These images can be checked against the images in
``src/examples/paraview-vis/tests/baseline_images``.

- Test ``proxies/cloverleaf3d``

  - Go to a directory where you intend to run cloverleaf3d integration
    (for ``summit.olcf.ornl.gov`` use a member work directory such as
    ``cd $MEMBERWORK/csc340``).

  - Create links to required files for cloverleaf3d:

    - ``ln -s $(spack location --install-dir ascent)/examples/ascent/paraview-vis/paraview_ascent_source.py``

    - ``ln -s $(spack location --install-dir ascent)/examples/ascent/paraview-vis/paraview-vis-cloverleaf3d.py paraview-vis.py``
      for surface visualization.

    - Or ``ln -s $(spack location --install-dir ascent)/examples/ascent/paraview-vis/paraview-vis-cloverleaf3d-momentinvariants.py paraview-vis.py``
      for MomentInvariants visualization (Optional)

    -
      .. code:: bash

              ln -s $(spack location --install-dir ascent)/examples/ascent/paraview-vis/ascent_actions.json
              ln -s $(spack location --install-dir ascent)/examples/ascent/paraview-vis/expandingVortex.vti
              ln -s $(spack location --install-dir ascent)/examples/ascent/proxies/cloverleaf3d/clover.in

  - Run the simulation

    ``$(spack location --install-dir mpi)/bin/mpiexec -n 2 $(spack location --install-dir ascent)/examples/ascent/proxies/cloverleaf3d/cloverleaf3d_par > output.txt 2>&1``

  - Examine the generated images

- Similarily test ``proxies/kripke``, ``proxies/laghos``,
  ``proxies/lulesh``, ``synthetic/noise``. After you create the
  apropriate links similarily with ``cloverleaf3d`` you can run these
  simulations with:

  - ``$(spack location --install-dir mpi)/bin/mpiexec -np 8 ./kripke_par --procs 2,2,2 --zones 32,32,32 --niter 5 --dir 1:2 --grp 1:1 --legendre 4 --quad 4:4 > output.txt 2>&1``

  - ``$(spack location --install-dir mpi)/bin/mpiexec -n 8 ./laghos_mpi -p 1 -m data/cube01_hex.mesh -rs 2 -tf 0.6 -visit -pa > output.txt 2>&1``

  - ``$(spack location --install-dir mpi)/bin/mpiexec -np 8 ./lulesh_par -i 10 -s 32 > output.txt 2>&1``

  - ``$(spack location --install-dir mpi)/bin/mpiexec -np 8 ./noise_par  --dims=32,32,32 --time_steps=5 --time_delta=1 > output.txt 2>&1``


Setup and run on summit.olcf.ornl.gov
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Execute section :ref:`paraview_setup_spack`

- Configure spack

  - add a file ``~/.spack/packages.yaml`` with the following content:

    .. code:: yaml

          packages:
           spectrum-mpi:
             modules:
               spectrum-mpi@10.3.0.1-20190611: spectrum-mpi/10.3.0.1-20190611
             buildable: False
           cuda:
             modules:
               cuda@10.1.168: cuda/10.1.168
             buildable: False


  - Load the correct compiler:

    .. code:: bash

          module load gcc/7.4.0
          spack compiler add
          spack compiler remove gcc@4.8.5


- Compile spack packages on a compute node

  - For busy summit I got ``internal compiler error`` when
    compiling ``llvm`` and ``paraview`` on the login node. To fix this, move
    the spack installation on ``$MEMBERWORK/csc340`` and
    compile everything on a compute node.

    - First login to a compute node (for an hour): ``bsub -W 1:00 -nnodes 1 -P CSC340 -Is /bin/bash``

    - Install all spack packages as in :ref:`paraview_install` with ``-j80`` option (there are 84 threads)

    - Disconnect from the compute node: ``exit``.

- Continue with :ref:`paraview_run_integrations` but run the integrations as described next:

  - Execute cloverleaf
    ``bsub $(spack location --install-dir ascent)/examples/ascent/paraview-vis/summit-moment-invariants.lsf``
  - To check if the integration finished use: ``bjobs -a``

Nightly tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We provide a docker file for Ubuntu 18.04 and a script that installs
the latest ParaView and Ascent, runs the integrations provided with
Ascent, runs visualizations using ParaView pipelines and checks the
results. See ``tests/README-docker.md`` for how to create the docker
image, run the container and execute the test script.

Notes
^^^^^

- Global extents are computed for uniform and rectilinear topologies but
  they are not yet computed for a structured topology (lulesh). This
  means that for lulesh and datasets that have a structured topology we
  cannot save a correct parallel file that represents the whole dataset.

- For the ``laghos`` simulation accessed through Python extracts
  interface, only the higher order mesh is accessible at the moment,
  which is a uniform dataset. The documentation shows a non-uniform mesh but
  that is only available in the ``vtkm`` pipelines.



Using Ascent in Another Project
---------------------------------

Under ``src/examples`` there are examples demonstrating how to use Ascent in a CMake-based build system (``using-with-cmake``) and via a Makefile (``using-with-make``).
Under ``src/examples/proxies``  you can find example integrations using ascent in the Lulesh, Kripke, and Cloverleaf3D proxy-applications.
In ``src/examples/synthetic/noise`` you can find an example integration using our synthetic smooth noise application.


.. _building_with_docker:

Building Ascent in a Docker Container
---------------------------------------

Under ``src/examples/docker/master/ubuntu`` there is an example ``Dockerfile`` which can be used to create an ubuntu-based docker image with a build of the Ascent github master branch. There is also a script that demonstrates how to build a Docker image from the Dockerfile (``example_build.sh``) and a script that runs this image in a Docker container (``example_run.sh``). The Ascent repo is cloned into the image's file system at ``/ascent``, the build directory is ``/ascent/build-debug``, and the install directory is ``/ascent/install-debug``.


.. _building_manually:

Building Ascent Dependencies Manually
-------------------------------------

In some environments, a spack build of Ascents dependencies can fail or a user may prefer to build the dependencies manually.
This section describes how to build Ascents components.
When building Ascents dependencies, it is **highly** recommended to fill out a host config file like the one located in ``/host-configs/boilerplate.cmake``.
This is the best way to avoid problems that can easily arise from mixing c++ standard libraries conflicts, MPI library conflicts, and fortran module conflicts, all of which are difficult to spot.
Use the same CMake host-config file for each of Ascent's dependencies, and while this may bring in unused cmake variables and clutter the ccmake curses interface, it will help avoid problems.
In the host config, you can specify options such as ``ENABLE_PYTHON=OFF``, ``ENABLE_FORTRAN=OFF``, and ``ENABLE_MPI=ON`` that will be respected by both conduit and ascent.

HDF5 (Optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `HDF5 source tarball <https://support.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/releases/hdf5-1.8/hdf5-1.8.16/src/hdf5-1.8.16.tar.gz>`_ on the HDF5 group's website. While the source contains both an autotools configure and CMake build system, use the CMake build system with your host config file.
Once you have built and installed HDF5 into a local directory, add the location of that directory to the declaration of the ``HDF5_DIR`` in the host config file.

.. code:: bash

    curl https://support.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/releases/hdf5-1.8/hdf5-1.8.16/src/hdf5-1.8.16.tar.gz > hdf5.tar.gz
    tar -xzf hdf5.tar.gz
    cd hdf5-1.8.16/
    mkdir build
    mkdir install
    cd build
    cmake -C path_to_host_config/myhost_config.cmake . \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path_to_install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make install

In the host config, add ``set(HDF5_DIR "/path/to/hdf5_install" CACHE PATH "")``.

Conduit
^^^^^^^
The version of conduit we use is the master branch. If the ``HDF5_DIR`` is specified in the host config,
then conduit will build the relay io library.
Likewise, if the config file has the entry ``ENABLE_MPI=ON``, then conduit will build
parallel versions of the libraries.
Once you have installed conduit, add the path to the install directory to your host
config file in the cmake variable ``CONDUIT_DIR``.

.. code:: bash

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/LLNL/conduit.git
    cd conduit
    mkdir build
    mkdir install
    cd build
    cmake -C path_to_host_config/myhost_config.cmake ../src \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path_to_install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make install

In the host config, add ``set(CONDUIT_DIR "/path/to/conduit_install" CACHE PATH "")``.


.. _building_vtkm:

VTK-m (Optional but recommended)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We currently use the master branch of vtkm and checkout a specific commit for stability.
This is the current commit we build and test against:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../hashes.txt
    :linenos:
    :language: python
    :lines: 1

We recommend VTK-m since VTK-m and VTK-h provide the majority of Ascent's visualization and analysis functionality.
The code below is minimal, and will only configure the serial device adapter. For instructions on building with TBB and CUDA, please consult the
`VTK-m repository <https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk-m>`_. In Ascent, we require non-default configure options, so pay close attention to the extra cmake configure options.

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk-m.git
    cd vtk-m
    git checkout commit_hash_listed_above
    mkdir build
    mkdir install
    cmake -C path_to_host_config/myhost_config.cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path_to_install \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DVTKm_USE_64BIT_IDS=OFF -DVTKm_USE_DOUBLE_PRECISION=ON \
      -DVTKm_USE_DEFAULT_TYPES_FOR_ASCENT=ON -DVTKm_NO_DEPRECATED_VIRTUAL=OFF
    make install


In the host config, add ``set(VTKM_DIR "/path/to/vtkm_install" CACHE PATH "")``.

.. _building_vtkh:

VTK-h (Optional but recommended)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We recommend VTK-h since VTK-m and VTK-h provide the majority of Ascent's visualization and analysis functionality.
We currently use the develop branch of vtkm and checkout a specific commit for stability.
This is the current commit we build and test against:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../hashes.txt
    :linenos:
    :language: python
    :lines: 2

.. code:: bash

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/vtk-h.git
    cd vtk-h
    git checkout commit_hash_listed_above
    mkdir build
    mkdir install
    cd build
    cmake -C path_to_host_config/myhost_config.cmake ../src -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path_to_install
    make install


In the host config, add ``set(VTKH_DIR "/path/to/vtkh_install" CACHE PATH "")``.

Ascent
^^^^^^
Now that we have all the dependencies built and a host config file for our environment, we can now build Ascent.

.. code:: bash

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/ascent.git
    cd ascent
    mkdir build
    mkdir install
    cd build
    cmake -C path_to_host_config/myhost_config.cmake ../src -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path_to_install \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make install

To run the unit tests to make sure everything works, do ``make test``.
If you install these dependencies in a public place in your environment, we encourage you to make you host config publicly available by submitting a pull request to the Ascent repo.
This will allow others to easily build on that system by only following the Ascent build instructions.

Asking Ascent how its configured
--------------------------------
Once built, Ascent has a number of unit tests. ``t_ascent_smoke``, located in the ``tests/ascent`` directory will print Ascent's
build configuration:

.. code-block:: json

        {
                "version": "0.4.0",
                "compilers":

                        "cpp": "/usr/tce/packages/gcc/gcc-4.9.3/bin/g++",
                        "fortran": "/usr/tce/packages/gcc/gcc-4.9.3/bin/gfortran"
                },
                "platform": "linux",
                "system": "Linux-3.10.0-862.6.3.1chaos.ch6.x86_64",
                "install_prefix": "/usr/local",
                "mpi": "disabled",
                "runtimes":
                {
                        "ascent":
                        {
                                "status": "enabled",
                                "vtkm":
                                {
                                        "status": "enabled",
                                        "backends":
                                        {
                                                "serial": "enabled",
                                                "openmp": "enabled",
                                                "cuda": "disabled"
                                        }
                                }
                        },
                        "flow":
                        {
                                "status": "enabled"
                        }
                },
                "default_runtime": "ascent"
        }

In this case, the non-MPI version of Ascent was used, so MPI reportsa as disabled.
