Pipelines
=========
Pipelines allow users to compose filters that transform the published input data into new meshes.
This is where users specify typical geometric transforms (e.g., clipping and slicing), field based transforms (e.g., threshold and contour), etc.
The resulting data from each Pipeline can be used as input to Scenes or Extracts.
Each pipeline contains one or more filters that transform the published mesh data.
When more than one filter is specified, each successive filter consumes the result of the previous filter, and filters are executed in the order in which they are declared.

The code below shows how to declare two pipelines, and generate images of the pipeline results.
The first applies a contour filter to extract two isosurfaces of the scalar field ``noise``.
The second pipeline applies a threshold filter to screen the ``noise`` field, and then a clip
filter to extract the intersection of what remains from the threshold with a sphere.

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "contour";
  // filter parameters
  conduit::Node contour_params;
  contour_params["field"] = "noise";
  constexpr int num_iso_values = 2;
  double iso_values[num_iso_values] = {0.0, 0.5};
  contour_params["iso_values"].set_external(iso_values, num_iso_values);
  pipelines["pl1/f1/params"] = contour_params;

  // pipeline 2
  pipelines["pl2/f1/type"] = "threshold";
  // filter parameters
  conduit::Node thresh_params;
  thresh_params["field"]  = "noise";
  thresh_params["min_value"] = 0.0;
  thresh_params["max_value"] = 0.5;
  pipelines["pl2/f1/params"] = thresh_params;

  pipelines["pl2/f2/type"]   = "clip";
  // filter parameters
  conduit::Node clip_params;
  clip_params["topology"] = "mesh";
  clip_params["sphere/center/x"] = 0.0;
  clip_params["sphere/center/y"] = 0.0;
  clip_params["sphere/center/z"] = 0.0;
  clip_params["sphere/radius"]   = .1;
  pipelines["pl2/f2/params/"] = clip_params;

  // make some imaages of the data
  conduit::Node scenes;
  // add a plot of pipeline 1
  scenes["s1/plots/p1/type"] = "pseudocolor";
  scenes["s1/plots/p1/pipeline"] = "pl1";
  scenes["s1/plots/p1/field"] = "noise";

  // add a plot of pipeline 2
  scenes["s2/plots/p1/type"] = "pseudocolor";
  scenes["s2/plots/p1/pipeline"] = "pl2";
  scenes["s2/plots/p1/field"] = "noise";

  // setup actions
  conduit::Node actions;

  conduit::Node add_pipelines = actions.append();
  add_pipelines["action"] = "add_pipelines";
  add_pipelines["pipelines"] = pipelines;

  conduit::Node add_scenes = actions.append();
  add_scenes["action"] = "add_scenes";
  add_scenes["scenes"] = scenes;

  actions.append()["action"] = "execute";

  Ascent ascent;
  ascent.open();
  ascent.publish(mesh); // mesh not shown
  ascent.execute(actions);
  ascent.close();

Ascent and VTK-h are under heavy development and features are being added rapidly.
As we stand up the infrastructure necessary to support a wide variety filter we created the following filters for the alpha release:

  - Contour
  - Threshold
  - Slice
  - Three Slice
  - Clip
  - Clip by field
  - Isovolume
  - Vector magnitude

In the following section we provide brief descriptions and code examples of the supported filters.
For complete code examples, please consult the unit tests located in ``src/tests/ascent``..


Filters
-------
Our filter API consists of the type of filter and the parameters associated with the filter in the general form:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "type"   : "filter_name",
    "params":
    {
      "string_param" : "string",
      "double_param" : 2.0
    }
  }

In c++, the equivalent declarations would be as follows:

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node filter;
  filter["type"] = "filter_name";
  filter["params/string_param"] = "string";
  filter["params/double_param"] = 2.0;

Included Filters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Contour
~~~~~~~
The contour filter evaluates a node-centered scalar field for all points at a given iso-value.
This results in a surface if the iso-value is within the scalar field.
``iso_vals`` can contain a single double or an array of doubles.
Additionally, instead of specifying exact iso-values, a number of 'levels' can be entered.
In this case, iso-values will be created evenly spaced through the scalar range. For example,
if the scalar range is `[0.0, 1.0]` and 'levels' is set to `3`, then the iso-values `(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)`
will be created.
The code below provides examples creating a pipeline using all three methods:

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "contour";
  // filter knobs
  conduit::Node &contour_params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  contour_params["field"] = "braid";
  contour_params["iso_values"] = -0.4;

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "contour";
  // filter knobs
  conduit::Node &contour_params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  contour_params["field"] = "braid";
  constexpr int num_iso_values = 3;
  double iso_vals[num_iso_values] = {-0.4, 0.2, 0.4};
  contour_params["iso_values"].set_external(iso_vals, num_iso_values);

  // filter knobs
  conduit::Node &contour_params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  contour_params["field"] = "braid";
  contour_params["levels"] = 5;

Threshold
~~~~~~~~~
The threshold filter removes cells that are not contained within a specified scalar range.

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "threshold";
  // filter knobs
  conduit::Node &thresh_params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  thresh_params["field"] = "braid";
  thresh_params["min_value"] = -0.2;
  thresh_params["max_value"] = 0.2;

The full example is located in the file `threshold test <https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/ascent/blob/develop/src/tests/ascent/t_ascent_threshold.cpp>`_.

Slice
~~~~~
The slice filter extracts a 2d plane from a 3d data set.
The plane is defined by a point (on the plane) and a normal vector (not required to be normalized).

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "slice";
  // filter knobs
  conduit::Node &slice_params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  slice_params["point/x"] = 0.f;
  slice_params["point/y"] = 0.f;
  slice_params["point/z"] = 0.f;

  slice_params["normal/x"] = 0.f;
  slice_params["normal/y"] = 0.f;
  slice_params["normal/z"] = 1.f;

.. _slicefig:

..  figure:: ../images/slice.png
    :scale: 50 %
    :align: center

    An example image of the slice filter on a element-centered variable using the previous code sample.

:numref:`Figure %s <slicefig>` shows an image produced from the slice filter.
The full example is located in the file `slice test <https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/ascent/blob/develop/src/tests/ascent/t_ascent_slice.cpp>`_.

Three Slice
~~~~~~~~~~~
The three slice filter slices 3d data sets using three axis-aligned slice planes and
leaves the resulting planes in 3d where they can all be viewed at the same time.
Three slice is meant primarily for quick visual exploration of 3D data where the
internal features cannot be readily observed from the outside.

The slice planes will automatically placed at the center of the data sets spatial extents.
Optionally, offsets for each plane can be specified. Offsets for each axis are specified
by a floating point value in the range ``[-1.0, 1.0]``, where ``-1.0`` places the plane at the
minimum spatial extent on the axis, ``1.0`` places the plane at the maximum spatial extent
on the axis, and ``0.0`` places the plane at the center of the spatial extent. By default,
all three offsets are ``0.0``.

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "3slice";

.. _threeslicefig:

..  figure:: ../images/three_slice.png
    :scale: 50 %
    :align: center

    An example image of the three slice filter on a element-centered variable using the
    previous code sample with automatic slice plane placement.

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "3slice";

  // filter knobs (all these are optional)
  conduit::Node &slice_params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  slice_params["x_offset"] = 1.f;   // largest value on the x-axis
  slice_params["y_offset"] = 0.f;   // middle of the y-axis
  slice_params["z_offset"] = -1.f;  // smalles value of the z-axis

.. _threeslice2fig:

..  figure:: ../images/three_slice2.png
    :scale: 50 %
    :align: center

    An example image of the three slice filter on a element-centered variable using the
    previous code sample with user specified offsets for each axis.

The full example is located in the file `slice test <https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/ascent/blob/develop/src/tests/ascent/t_ascent_slice.cpp>`_.

Clip
~~~~
The clip filter removes cells from the specified topology using implicit functions.
By default, only the area outside of the implicit function remains, but the clip
can be inverted. There are three implicit functions that clip can use: sphere, box,
and plane.

.. code-block:: c++

  // define a clip by a sphere
  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "clip";
  // filter knobs
  conduit::Node &clip_params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  clip_params["topology"] = "mesh";
  clip_params["sphere/radius"] = 11.;
  clip_params["sphere/center/x"] = 0.;
  clip_params["sphere/center/y"] = 0.;
  clip_params["sphere/center/z"] = 0.;

.. _clipspherefig:

..  figure:: ../images/clip.png
    :scale: 50 %
    :align: center

    An example image of the clip filter using the previous code sample.
    The data set is a cube with extents from (-10, -10, -10) to (10, 10, 10), and the code removes a sphere centered at the origin with a radius of 11.

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "clip";
  // filter knobs
  conduit::Node &clip_params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  clip_params["topology"] = "mesh";
  clip_params["invert"] = "true";
  clip_params["sphere/radius"] = 11.;
  clip_params["sphere/center/x"] = 0.;
  clip_params["sphere/center/y"] = 0.;
  clip_params["sphere/center/z"] = 0.;

.. _clipsphereInvertedfig:

..  figure:: ../images/clip_inverted.png
    :scale: 50 %
    :align: center

    An example of the same sphere clip, but in this case, the clip is inverted.

.. code-block:: c++

  // define a clip by a box
  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "clip";
  // filter knobs
  conduit::Node &clip_params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  clip_params["topology"] = "mesh";
  clip_params["box/min/x"] = 0.;
  clip_params["box/min/y"] = 0.;
  clip_params["box/min/z"] = 0.;
  clip_params["box/max/x"] = 10.01; // <=
  clip_params["box/max/y"] = 10.01;
  clip_params["box/max/z"] = 10.01;

.. _clipboxfig:

..  figure:: ../images/box_clip.png
    :scale: 50 %
    :align: center

    A box clip of the same data set that removes the octant on the positive x, y, and z axes.

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "clip";
  // filter knobs
  conduit::Node &clip_params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  clip_params["topology"] = "mesh";
  clip_params["plane/point/x"] = 0.;
  clip_params["plane/point/y"] = 0.;
  clip_params["plane/point/z"] = 0.;
  clip_params["plane/normal/x"] = 1.;
  clip_params["plane/normal/y"] = 0.;
  clip_params["plane/normal/z"] = 0;

.. _clipplanefig:

..  figure:: ../images/clip_plane.png
    :scale: 50 %
    :align: center

    Clipping by a plane defined by a point on the plane and the plane normal.

:numref:`Figures %s <clipspherefig>`,
:numref:`%s <clipsphereInvertedfig>`,
:numref:`%s <clipboxfig>`, and
:numref:`%s <clipplanefig>` show an images produced from the clip filter.
All of the clip  examples are located in the file `clip test <https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/ascent/blob/develop/src/tests/ascent/t_ascent_clip.cpp>`_.

Clip By Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The clip by field filter removes cells from the specified topology using the values in a scalar field.
By default, all values below the clip value are removed from the data set. As with clip by implicit function,
the clip can be inverted.

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "clip_with_field";
  // filter knobs
  conduit::Node &clip_params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  clip_params["field"] = "braid";
  clip_params["clip_value"] = 0.;

.. _clipfieldfig:

..  figure:: ../images/clip_field.png
    :scale: 50 %
    :align: center

    An example of clipping all values below 0 in a data set.

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "clip_with_field";
  // filter knobs
  conduit::Node &clip_params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  clip_params["field"] = "braid";
  clip_params["invert"] = "true";
  clip_params["clip_value"] = 0.;

.. _clipfieldinvertedfig:

..  figure:: ../images/clip_field_inverted.png
    :scale: 50 %
    :align: center

    An example of clipping all values above 0 in a data set.

IsoVolume
~~~~~~~~~
IsoVolume is a filter that clips a data set based on a minimum
and maximum value in a scalar field. All value outside of the minimum and maximum
values are removed from the data set.

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "iso_volume";
  // filter knobs
  conduit::Node &clip_params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  clip_params["field"] = "braid";
  clip_params["min_value"] = 5.;
  clip_params["max_value"] = 10.;

.. _isovolume:

..  figure:: ../images/iso_volume.png
    :scale: 50 %
    :align: center

    An example of creating a iso-volume of values between 5.0 and 10.0.

Vector Magnitude
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Vector magnitude creates a new field on the data set representing the magitude
of a vector variable. The only parameters are the input vector field name
and the name of the new field.

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "vector_magnitude";
  // filter knobs (all these are optional)
  conduit::Node &params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  params["field"] = "vel";         // name of the vector field
  params["output_name"] = "mag";   // name of the output field

.. _vecmag:

..  figure:: ../images/vector_magnitude.png
    :scale: 50 %
    :align: center

    An example of creating a pseudocolor plot of vector magnitude


Vector Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Vector component creates a new scalar field on the data set by
extracting a component of a vector field. There are three required
parameters: the input field, the output field name, and the index
of the component to extract.

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "vector_component";
  // filter knobs (all these are optional)
  conduit::Node &params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  params["field"] = "vel";         // name of the vector field
  params["output_name"] = "vel_x"; // name of the output field
  params["component"] = 0; // index of the component

Composite Vector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Composite Vector creates a new vector field on the data set
by combining two or three scalar fields into a vector.
The first two fields are required and the presense of the
third field dictates whether a 2D or 3D vector is created.
Input fields can be different types (e.g., int32 and float32),
and the resulting vector field will be a float64.

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "vector_component";
  // filter knobs (all these are optional)
  conduit::Node &params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  params["field1"] = "pressure";      // (required)
  params["field1"] = "temperature";   // (required)
  params["field1"] = "bananas";       // (optional, 2D vector if not present)
  params["output_name"] = "my_vec";   // (required) name of the output field
  params["component"] = 0; // (required) index of the component


Recenter
~~~~~~~~
Recenter changes the association of a field. Fields associated with either `element` or `vertex` can
be interchanged by averaging the surrounding values. When recentering to a element associated field, all vertex
values incident to a element are averaged, and similarly when rencentering to a vertex associated field,
all element values incident to the vertex are averaged. If a field is already of the desired associated, then
the nothing is done and the field is simply passed through the filter. Note: ghost zones must be available when
the data set has more than one domain. Without ghost, the averaging will not be smooth across domain boundaries.

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "recenter";
  conduit::Node &params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  params["field"] = "braid";         // name of the vector field
  params["association"] = "vertex";   // output field association
  // or params["association"] = "element";   // output field association

Gradient
~~~~~~~~
Computes the gradient of a vertex-centered input field for every element
in the input data set. Fields will be automaticall recentered if they
are elemenet-centered.
The gradient computation can either generate cell center based gradients,
which are fast but less accurate, or more accurate but slower
point based gradients (default).

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "gradient";
  // filter knobs (all these are optional)
  conduit::Node &params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  params["field"] = "velocity";          // (required)
  params["output_name"] = "my_grad";     // (required) name of the output field
  params["use_cell_gradient"] = "false"; // (optional)


Vorticity
~~~~~~~~~
Computes the vorticity of a vertex-centered input field for every element
in the input data set. Fields will be automaticall recentered if they
are elemenet-centered.
The vorticity computation (based on the gradient) can either generate
cell center based gradients, which are fast but less accurate, or more
accurate but slower point based gradients (default).

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "vorticity";
  // filter knobs (all these are optional)
  conduit::Node &params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  params["field"] = "velocity";          // (required)
  params["output_name"] = "my_vorticity";// (required) name of the output field
  params["use_cell_gradient"] = "false"; // (optional)

Q-Criterion
~~~~~~~~~~~
Computes the qcriterion of a vertex-centered input field for every element
in the input data set. Fields will be automaticall recentered if they
are elemenet-centered.
The qcriterion computation (based on the gradient) can either generate
cell center based gradients, which are fast but less accurate, or more
accurate but slower point based gradients (default).

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "qcriterion";
  // filter knobs (all these are optional)
  conduit::Node &params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  params["field"] = "velocity";          // (required)
  params["output_name"] = "my_q";        // (required) name of the output field
  params["use_cell_gradient"] = "false"; // (optional)

Partitioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Partitioning meshes is commonly needed in order to evenly distribute work
among many simulation ranks. Ascent utilizes the ``partition()`` functions provided from Conduit::Blueprint. Blueprint provides two ``partition()`` functions
that can be used to split or recombine Blueprint meshes in serial or parallel.
Full M:N repartioning is supported. The ``partition()`` functions are in the
serial and parallel Blueprint libraries, respectively.

.. code:: cpp

    // Serial
    void conduit::blueprint::mesh::partition(const Node &mesh,
                                             const Node &options,
                                             Node &output);

    // Parallel
    void conduit::blueprint::mpi::mesh::partition(const Node &mesh,
                                                  const Node &options,
                                                  Node &output,
                                                  MPI_Comm comm);


Partitioning meshes using Blueprint will use any options present to determine
how the partitioning process will behave. Typically, a caller would pass options
containing selections if pieces of domains are desired. The partitioner processes
any selections and then examines the desired target number of domains and will then
decide whether domains must be moved among ranks (only in parallel version) and
then locally combined to achieve the target number of domains. The combining
process will attempt to preserve the input topology type for the output topology.
However, in cases where lower topologies cannot be used, the algorithm will promote
the extracted domain parts towards more general topologies and use the one most
appropriate to contain the inputs.

In parallel, the ``partition()`` function will make an effort to redistribute data across MPI
ranks to attempt to balance how data are assigned. Domains produced from selections
are assigned round-robin across ranks from rank 0 through rank N-1 until all
domains have been assigned. This assignment is carried out after extracting
selections locally so they can be restributed among ranks
before being combined into the target number of domains.


.. figure:: partition.png
    :width: 800px
    :align: center

    Partition used to re-partition a 7 domain mesh (left) to different target numbers of domains and to isolate logical subsets.


Options
~~~~~~
The ``partition()`` functions accept a node containing options. The options node
can be empty and all options are optional. If no options are given, each input mesh
domain will be fully selected. It is more useful to pass selections as part of the
option node with additional options that tell the algorithm how to split or combine
the inputs. If no selections are present in the options node then the partitioner
will create selections of an  appropriate type that selects all elements in each
input domain.

The ``target`` option is useful for setting the target number of domains in the
final output mesh. If the target value is larger than the number of input domains
or selections then the mesh will be split to achieve that target number of domains.
This may require further subdividing selections. Alternatively, if the target is
smaller than the number of selections then the selections will be combined to
yield the target number of domains. The combining is done such that smaller element
count domains are combined first. Additionally, Ascent provides an optional boolean parameter, ``distributed``, which dictates if the number of chosen target domains is applied across ranks (``true``, default), or to each rank individually (``false``).

Selections
~~~~~~~~~~~
Selections can be specified in the options for the ``partition()`` function to
select regions of interest that will participate in mesh partitioning. If
selections are not used then all elements from the input meshes will be
selected to partitipate in the partitioning process. Selections can be further
subdivided if needed to arrive at the target number of domains. Selections can
target specific domains and topologies as well. If a selection does not apply
to the input mesh domains then no geometry is produced in the output for that
selection.

The ``partition()`` function's options support 4 types of selections:

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{1.5cm}|p{2cm}|L|

=============== =============================== =============================================
Selection Type  Topologies                      Description
=============== =============================== =============================================
logical          uniform,rectilinear,structured Identifies start and end logical IJK ranges to select sub-bricks of uniform, rectilinear, or structured topologies. This selection is not compatible with other topologies.
explicit         all                            Identifies an explicit list of element ids and it works with all topologies.
ranges           all                            Identifies ranges of element ids, provided as pairs so the user can select multiple contiguous blocks of elements. This selection works with all topologies
field            all                            Uses a specified field to indicate destination domain for each element.
=============== =============================== =============================================

By default, a selection does not apply to any specific domain_id. A list of
selections applied to a single input mesh will extract multiple new domains from
that original input mesh. Since meshes are composed of many domains in practice,
selections can also be associated with certain domain_id values. Selections that
provide a domain_id value will only match domains that either have a matching
state/domain_id value or match its index in the input node's list of children
(if state/domain_id is not present).

Selections can apply to certain topology names as well. By default, the first
topology is used but if the ``topology`` name is provided then the selection will
operate on the specified topology only.

Logical Selection
*****************
The logical selection allows the partitioner to extract a logical IJK subset from uniform, rectilinear,
or structured topologies. The selection is given as IJK start and end values. If the end values extend
beyond the actual mesh's logical extents, they will be clipped. The partitioner may
automatically subdivide logical selections into smaller logical selections, if needed,
preserving the logical structure of the input topology into the output.

.. code:: yaml

  selections:
    -
     type: logical
     start: [0,0,0]
     end: [9,9,9]

Explicit Selection
******************
The explicit selection allows the partitioner to extract a list of elements.
This is used when the user wants to target a specific set of elements.
The output will result in an explicit topology.

.. code:: yaml

  selections:
    -
     type: explicit
     elements: [0,1,2,3,100,101,102]


Ranges Selection
****************
The ranges selection is similar to the explicit selection except that it identifies
ranges of elements using pairs of numbers. The list of ranges must be a multiple of
2 in length. The output will result in an explicit topology.

.. code:: yaml

  selections:
    -
     type: ranges
     ranges: [0,3,100,102]

Field Selection
***************
The field selection enables the partitioner to use partitions done by other tools
using a field on the mesh as the source of the final domain number for each element.
The field must be associated with the mesh elements. When using a field selection,
the partitioner will make a best attempt to use the domain numbers to extract
mesh pieces and reassemble them into domains with those numberings. If a larger
target value is specified, then field selections can sometimes be partitioned further
as explicit partitions. The field selection is unique in that its ``domain_id`` value
can be set to "any" if it is desired that the field selection will be applied to
all domains in the input mesh. The domain_id value can still be set to specific
integer values to limit the set of domains over which the selection will be applied.

.. code:: yaml

  selections:
    -
     type: field
     domain_id: any
     field: fieldname
